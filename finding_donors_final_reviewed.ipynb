    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three appropriate models for this are random forest, adaboost and logistic regression.The real world application of models I have selected here is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) AdaBoost: This model was used previously in my company back in india to identify sections of customers and what is the purpose of their calls and in marketing for customer churn. The AdaBoost could identify the churn patterns correctly over almost all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strength: The adaboost tries to minimize error everytime by giving higher weights to the points that are misclassified and lessening the weights of points that are correctly classified. After a certain estimations it adds all the boundaries together to make the composite boundaries giving us the seperation of our classes. Experimental results also shows us that adaboost is not prone to overfitting. This algorithm corrects the mistakes of its weak classifiers and improves the accuracy overall by combining its weak learners. Several base classifiers can be used with adaboost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness: Adaboost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. As it corrects the error till every point is correctly classified in training set, it is susceptible in rare cases to overfit than other learning algorithms. Slowest to run compared to two other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good candidate: The classes that we must classify are only two. The data is cleaned and barely consists of any outliers or noise. Thus this makes this ensemble one of the suitable candidate for classifying our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Logistic Regression: This model is in use in my fiance's hospital at Arizona to identify patients with prostate cancer. The model emphasizes heavily on PSA test, size or enlargement of prostate, orthopedic parameters of patients and urinary discomforts of patients. The reason being prostate cancer being very closely related to these features in patient reports. The model predicts the likelihood of patient having the prostate cancer and whether the patient wishes to spend further for tests ahead like PET Scan, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**strength: The model performs very well in case if there are two classes and this is exactly what we have at hand here. The model requires barely any parameter tuning. It is the most model type when it comes to building a classifier and hence it can be understood well from its deep mathematics to output we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness: This model on the other hand being basic causes high bias. Also it is preferrable to have linearly seperable data for better performace while using logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good candidate: The model as described is one of the ideal candidate when we have linearly seperable data and have two classes to classify our output in. This is exactly what we are going to do here when classifying individuals with '>50K' and '<=50K'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Random Forest: I never had a chance yet to view a random forest applied in real world. But I as a part of ensemble method, I can assume for now that it would give a constructive output which would outperform or atleast be competitive to other 2 models that are used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strength: Relatively quick to train. Excellent at predicting/classifying on all types of data without overfitting. It does not suffer from the overfitting problem. The main reason is that it takes the average of all the predictions, which cancels out the biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness: Slow to run compared to other Logistic Regression method because Random forests is slow in generating predictions because it has multiple decision trees. Whenever it makes a prediction, all the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same given input and then perform voting on it. This whole process is time-consuming. Black Box model meaning we can't really see what's happening under the hood. The model is difficult to interpret compared to a decision tree, where you can easily make a decision by following the path in the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good candidate: Random Forests algorithm is flexibile and has ability to correct individual decision trees proneness to overfitting by sampling many of them."

    "keeping in mind about the accuracy and the F-score, we select adaboost classifier out of all three algorithms testing on test set. I recommend this classifier because of higher accuracy and F-Score on testing set than the logistic regression and random forest classifier. But the drawback is that the adaboostclassifier is slower to train than the other two.Nevertheless, we would still go with adaboost classifier as we have seen that the individuals earning higher than $50K are less than 25% of our total records, we shall rely on higher F Score."

    "The adaboost classifier first generates a very basic classificatier for the two classes of '>50k' and '<=50k'by giving 1 and -1 as outputs for both of them when correctly classified. When the adaboost output is misclassified, then it gives 1 otherwise 0.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Just to brief; this 1 gets multiplied with corresponding weight of that corresponding point and then error is calculated. After this the weights are tuned to minimize this error. The points which were misclassified gets higher weights and the ones that were correctly classified have their weights lowered. Then it again classifies in mannner that the points having higher weights gets classified correctly. After several such iterations the adaboosts stops at a point where it feels that it has classified most of points correctly. This process is done sequentially in that the two weights are adjusted at each step as iterations of the algorithm proceed.\n",

    "The idea is to set weights to both classifiers and data points (samples) in a way that forces classifiers to concentrate on observations that are difficult to correctly classify. \n",

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation\n",
    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "\n",
    "Out of the thirteen. I believe the top 5 in decrementing order or rank with rank 1 as most important are are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) captial-gain: because the more gains, the more is spending ability of individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) capital-loss: because if losses are incurred then spending ability is reduced, thereby decreasing a possibility for individual to fall in category of '>50K'\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) education level OR education-num: The higher the education, better is prospect of higher salaried job that crosses >50K mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) age: Individuals that are older have less responsibilites and are willing to contribute to society or its cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) work class: Individuals in private sector has better chances of earning higher salaries and thus can earn '>50K'. "

I thought that capital loss and capital gain would have more weight than education-num. But still as the the features I thought match to the ones that are displayed here, I feel that I am on the right path and I can happily move ahead with the answer for top 5 features given by my adaboost model in feature selection."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
